The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower
Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.
[3] The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 691 million people ascended it in 2015
The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris.
 Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930.
 It was the first structure to reach a height of 300 metres Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.
2 metres (17 ft) Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct
The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground – the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union.
 Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second.
 Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lif
The Statue of Liberty is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor in New York, in the United States.
 The copper statue, a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States, was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel
The statue is a figure of Libertas, a robed Roman liberty goddess. She holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed JULY IV MDCCLXXVI (July 4, 1776 in Roman numerals), the date of the U.
S Declaration of Independence. A broken shackle and chain lie at her feet as she walks forward, commemorating the recent national abolition of slavery.
[8] After its dedication, the statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States, seen as a symbol of welcome to immigrants arriving by se
Bartholdi was inspired by a French law professor and politician, Édouard René de Laboulaye, who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.
S independence would properly be a joint project of the French and U.S. peoples. Because of the post-war instability in France, work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s.
 In 1875, Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the US. provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions
The torch-bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882.
 Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds
 Publisher Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York World, started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar
 The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island
 The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Clevelan
The statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War; since 1933 it has been maintained by the National Park Service as part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument, and is a major tourist attraction.
 The monument has been temporarily closed since March 16, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic Public access to the balcony around the torch has been barred since 1916
The Cathedral of Vasily the Blessed, commonly known as Saint Basil's Cathedral, is a Christian church in Red Square in Moscow, Russia and is regarded as a cultural symbol of the country.
 The building, now a museum, is officially known as the Cathedral of the Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos on the Moat (Собо́р Покрова́ Пресвято́й Богоро́дицы, что на Рву, Sobor Pokrova Presvyatoy Bogoroditsy, chto na Rvu) or Pokrovsky Cathedral (Покро́вский собо́р)
[5] It was built from 1555 to 1561 on orders from Ivan the Terrible and commemorates the capture of Kazan and Astrakhan It was the city's tallest building until the completion of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower in 1600
The original building, known as Trinity Church and later Trinity Cathedral, contained eight churches arranged around a ninth, central church of Intercession; a tenth church was erected in 1588 over the grave of venerated local saint Vasily (Basil).
 In the 16th and 17th centuries, the church, perceived (as with all churches in Byzantine Christianity) as the earthly symbol of the Heavenly City,[7] was popularly known as the "Jerusalem" and served as an allegory of the Jerusalem Temple in the annual Palm Sunday parade attended by the Patriarch of Moscow and the Tsa
The building is shaped like the flame of a bonfire rising into the sky,[9] a design that has no parallel in Russian architecture.
 Dmitry Shvidkovsky, in his book Russian Architecture and the West, states that "it is like no other Russian building Nothing similar can be found in the entire millennium of Byzantine tradition from the fifth to the fifteenth century .
. a strangeness that astonishes by its unexpectedness, complexity and dazzling interleaving of the manifold details of its design.
"[10] The cathedral foreshadowed the climax of Russian national architecture in the 17th centur
As part of the program of state atheism, the church was confiscated from the Russian Orthodox community as part of the Soviet Union's antireligious campaigns and has operated as a division of the State Historical Museum since 1928.
[12] It was completely secularized in 1929[12] and remains a federal property of the Russian Federation The church has been part of the Moscow Kremlin and Red Square UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990.
[13] It is not actually within the Kremlin, but often served as a visual metonym for Russia and the Soviet Union in western media during the Cold War, to the point of being confused at times with the Kremlin itself by foreigners
[14] With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, weekly Orthodox Christian services with prayer to St Basil have been restored since 1997

The Palace of Versailles was the principal royal residence of France from 1682, under Louis XIV, until the start of the French Revolution in 1789, under Louis XVI.
 It is located in the department of Yvelines, in the region of Île-de-France, about 20 kilometres (12 miles) southwest of the centre of Pari
A simple hunting lodging and later a small château with a moat occupied the site until 1661, when the first work expanding the château into a palace was carried out for Louis XIV.
 In 1682, when the palace had become large enough, the king moved the entire royal court and the French government to Versailles
 Some of the palace furniture at this time was constructed of solid silver, but in 1689 much of it was melted down to pay for the cost of war
 Subsequent rulers mostly carried out interior remodeling, to meet the demands of changing taste, although Louis XV did install an opera house at the north end of the north wing for the wedding of the Dauphin and Marie Antoinette in 1770
 The palace has also been a site of historical importance The Peace of Paris (1783) was signed at Versailles, the Proclamation of the German Empire occurred in the vaunted Hall of Mirrors, and World War I was ended in the palace with the Treaty of Versailles, among many other events
The palace is now a historical monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, notable especially for the ceremonial Hall of Mirrors, the jewel-like Royal Opera, and the royal apartments; for the more intimate royal residences, the Grand Trianon and Petit Trianon located within the park; the small rustic Hameau (Hamlet) created for Marie Antoinette; and the vast Gardens of Versailles with fountains, canals, and geometric flower beds and groves, laid out by André le Nôtre.
 The Palace was stripped of all its furnishings after the French Revolution, but many pieces have been returned and many of the palace rooms have been restore
In 2017 the Palace of Versailles received 7,700,000 visitors, making it the second-most visited monument in the Île-de-France region, just behind the Louvre and ahead of the Eiffel Tower

Pasta is an Italian type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking.
 Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative
Pastas are divided into two broad categories: dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca). Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be produced at home.
 Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines[3] Fresh pastas available in grocery stores are produced commercially by large-scale machines
Both dried and fresh pastas come in a number of shapes and varieties, with 310 specific forms known by over 1300 documented names.
[4] In Italy, the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary by locale For example, the pasta form cavatelli is known by 28 different names depending upon the town and region.
 Common forms of pasta include long and short shapes, tubes, flat shapes or sheets, miniature shapes for soup, those meant to be filled or stuffed, and specialty or decorative shape
As a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes: as pasta asciutta (or pastasciutta), cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary side sauce or condiment; a second classification of pasta dishes is pasta in brodo, in which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish.
 A third category is pasta al forno, in which the pasta is incorporated into a dish that is subsequently baked in the oven
[6] Pasta dishes are generally simple, but individual dishes vary in preparation Some pasta dishes are served as a small first course or for light lunches, such as pasta salads.
 Other dishes may be portioned larger and used for dinner Pasta sauces similarly may vary in taste, color and texture
In terms of nutrition, cooked plain pasta is 31% carbohydrates (mostly starch), 6% protein, and low in fat, with moderate amounts of manganese, but pasta generally has low micronutrient content.
Popcorn (popped corn, popcorns or pop-corn) is a variety of corn kernel which expands and puffs up when heated; the same names are also used to refer to the foodstuff produced by the expansion
A popcorn kernel's strong hull contains the seed's hard, starchy shell endosperm with 14–20% moisture, which turns to steam as the kernel is heated.
 Pressure from the steam continues to build until the hull ruptures, allowing the kernel to forcefully expand, from 20 to 50 times its original size, and then coo
Some strains of corn (taxonomized as Zea mays) are cultivated specifically as popping corns. The Zea mays variety everta, a special kind of flint corn, is the most common of these
Popcorn is one of the six major types of corn, which includes dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, flour corn, and sweet corn
Paella is one of the best-known dishes in Spanish cuisine. For this reason, it may be seen internationally as Spain's national dish, but Spaniards almost unanimously consider it to be a dish from the Valencian region; those who live there, in turn, regard paella as one of their identifying symbols
Paella takes its name from the wide, shallow traditional pan used to cook the dish on an open fire. Paella means "frying pan" in Valencian, Valencia's regional language
As a dish, it may have ancient roots, but in its modern form it is traced back to the mid-19th century, in the rural area around the Albufera lagoon adjacent to the city of Valencia, on the east coast of Spain
Paella valenciana is the traditional paella of the Valencia region, believed to be the original recipe,[5] and consists of round grain rice[6], bajoqueta and tavella (varieties of green beans), rabbit, chicken, sometimes duck, garrofó (a variety of lima or butter bean),[7][8] and optionally snails.
 Artichoke hearts and stems may be used as seasonal ingredients Olive oil is used as a base, and saffron and (sometimes) whole rosemary branches are used as seasoning
Paella de marisco (seafood paella) replaces meat with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables, while paella mixta (mixed paella) combines meat from livestock, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes beans, with the traditional rice
Other popular local variations of paella are cooked all through the Mediterranean area, the rest of Spain and internationally
Risotto is a northern Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it reaches a creamy consistency. The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or vegetables.
 Many types of risotto contain butter, onion, white wine, and parmesan cheese It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Italy.

In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced and eaten with the use of a knife and fork.
[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the han
The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania.
[4] Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries[5] It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe and North America, available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, and via pizza delivery.
[5][6] Many companies sell ready-baked frozen pizzas to be reheated in an ordinary home ove
The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza.

Fish and chips is a hot dish consisting of fried fish in batter served with chips. The dish originated in England and is an example of culinary fusion, as its two main ingredients were introduced by immigrants.
[1][2] Fish and chips is a common take-away food in the United Kingdom and numerous other countries, particularly in English-speaking and Commonwealth nation
Fish and chips first appeared in the UK in the 1860s, and by 1910 there were over 25,000 fish and chip shops across the UK.
 By the 1930s there were over 35,000 shops, but the trend reversed and by 2009 there were only approximately 10,00
The British government safeguarded the supply of fish and chips during World War I and World War II and it was one of the few foods in the UK not subject to rationing during the wars
Green papaya salad is a spicy salad made from shredded unripe papaya. Originating from ethnic Lao people, it is also eaten throughout Southeast Asia
Poutine is a dish that includes french fries and cheese curds topped with a brown gravy. It originated in the Canadian province of Quebec and emerged in the late 1950s in the Centre-du-Québec area.
 It has long been associated with Quebec cuisine For many years, it was perceived negatively and mocked, and even used by some to stigmatize Quebec society.
 Poutine later became celebrated as a symbol of Québécois cultural pride Its rise in prominence led to its popularity outside the province, especially in Ontario, the Maritimes, and in the Northeastern United States
Annual poutine celebrations occur in Montreal, Quebec City, and Drummondville, as well as Toronto, Ottawa, and Chicago. Today, it is often identified as a quintessential Canadian food.
 It has been called "Canada's national dish", though some believe this labelling represents a misappropriation of Québécois national identity
 Many variations on the original recipe are popular, leading some to suggest that poutine has emerged as a new dish classification in its own right, as with sandwiches and dumpling
A taco is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a small hand-sized corn or wheat tortilla topped with a filling. The tortilla is then folded around the filling and eaten by hand.
 A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, vegetables, and cheese, allowing great versatility and variety
 They are often garnished with various condiments, such as salsa, guacamole, or sour cream, and vegetables, such as lettuce, onion, tomatoes, and chiles
 Tacos are a common form of antojitos, or Mexican street food, which have spread around the worl
Tacos can be contrasted with similar foods such as burrito, which are often much larger and rolled rather than folded, taquitos which are rolled and fried, or chalupas/tostadas, in which the tortilla is fried before filling
Tomato ketchup is a sauce but is used as a condiment. Although original recipes used egg whites, mushrooms, oysters, grapes, mussels, or walnuts, among other ingredients,[1][2] the unmodified modern recipe refers to tomato-based ketchup
Tomato ketchup is a sweet and tangy sauce made from tomatoes, sugar, and vinegar, with seasonings and spices. The spices and flavors vary, but commonly include onions, allspice, coriander, cloves, cumin, garlic, and mustard, and sometimes include celery, cinnamon, or ginger
The market leader in the United States (60% market share) and United Kingdom (82%) is Heinz.[5][6] Hunt's has the second largest share of the US market with less than 20%.
 In some of the UK, ketchup is also known as "tomato sauce" (a term that means a fresher pasta sauce elsewhere) or "red sauce" (especially in Wales
Tomato ketchup is most often used as a condiment to dishes that are usually served hot and may be fried or greasy: french fries, hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken tenders, tater tots, hot sandwiches, meat pies, cooked eggs, and grilled or fried meat.
 Ketchup is sometimes used as the basis for, or as one ingredient in, other sauces and dressings, and the flavor may be replicated as an additive flavoring for snacks, such as potato chip
Massaman curry is a rich, relatively mild Thai curry.[1] Cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, star anise, cumin, bay leaves, nutmeg and mace (spices that are not frequently used in Thai curries) are combined with more local flavors such as dried chili peppers, cilantro seeds, lemongrass, galangal, white pepper, shrimp paste, shallots and garlic to make massaman curry paste
In 2011, CNNGo ranked massaman curry as the #1 most delicious food in an article titled World's 50 most delicious foods.[2] However, the survey later that year, subtitled Readers' picks, ranked it #10.
Chocolate is a preparation of roasted and ground cacao seeds that is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, which may also be used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods.
 The earliest signs of use are associated with Olmec sites (within what would become Mexico’s post-colonial territory) suggesting consumption of chocolate beverages, dating from 19 centuries BCE
[1][2] The majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs[3] The word chocolate is derived from the Spanish word chocolate, deriving in turn from the Classical Nahuatl word xocolātl
The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted.
 The shell is removed to produce cacao nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor.
 The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar.
 Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar.
 Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids
Chocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies.
 Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks.
 Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day, and Hanukkah
 Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de caca
Although cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply
With some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and trafficking were major concerns in 2018.
[5][6] International attempts to improve conditions for children were failing because of persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labo
Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits.
 Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯
Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat.
 Many types of sushi are vegetarian It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish
Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice
Peking duck is a dish from Beijing (Peking)[1] that has been prepared since the imperial era. The meat is characterized by its thin, crisp skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, sliced in front of the diners by the cook.
 Ducks bred specially for the dish are slaughtered after 65 days and seasoned before being roasted in a closed or hung oven
 The meat is often eaten with spring onion, cucumber and sweet bean sauce with pancakes rolled around the fillings Sometimes pickled radish is also inside, and other sauces (like hoisin sauce) can be used
A hamburger (also burger for short) is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun.
 The patty may be pan fried, grilled, smoked[1] or flame broiled Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chiles; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or "special sauce"; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns.
The term "burger" can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the term "patty" is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef.
 Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity "burger" may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, or veggie burge
Hamburgers are sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and specialty and high-end restaurants (where burgers may sell for several times the cost of a fast-food burger, but may be one of the cheaper options on the menu).
Ice cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice)[1] is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert.
 It may be made from dairy milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and any spice, such as cocoa or vanilla
 Colourings are usually added, in addition to stabilizers The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming.
 The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F) It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases
The meaning of the name "ice cream" varies from one country to another. Terms such as "frozen custard," "frozen yogurt," "sorbet," "gelato," and others are used to distinguish different varieties and styles.
 In some countries, such as the United States, "ice cream" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of cream
[2] Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled "frozen dairy dessert" instead[3] In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants.
 Analogues made from dairy alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (eg., soy, cashew, coconut, almond milk or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan
Ice cream may be served in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or licked from edible cones. Ice cream may be served with other desserts, such as apple pie, or as an ingredient in ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, ice cream cakes and even baked items, such as Baked Alaska
Rendang is an Indonesian spicy meat dish originating from the Minangkabau region in West Sumatra, Indonesia.[3] It has spread across Indonesia to the cuisines of neighbouring Southeast Asian countries.
[1] Rendang is piece of meat — most commonly beef — slow cooked and braised in coconut milk and spice mixture,[4][5] well until the liquids evaporate and the meat turns dark brown, tender, caramelized, infused with rich spice
One of the specific signature dish of Minangkabau culture, rendang is traditionally served at ceremonial occasions to honour guests during festive events; such as wedding feasts and Hari Raya (Eid al-Fitr).
[6] Rendang is also traditionally served among the Malay community in Malaysia, and the Maranao in the Philippines[7] Although culinary experts often describe rendang as a curry,[3][8] the dish is usually not considered as such in Indonesia since it is richer and contains less liquid than is normal for Indonesian curries
In 2011, an online poll of 35,000 people by CNN International chose rendang as the No. 1 most delicious dish of their World's 50 most delicious foods: Readers' picks list (it was #11 on the original list).
[10][11] In 2018, rendang was officially recognised as being one of the 5 national dishes of Indonesia; the others are soto, sate, nasi goreng, and gado-gad
Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is the 45th and current president of the United States. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality
Trump was born and raised in Queens, a borough of New York City, and received a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School.
 He took charge of his family's real-estate business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, and expanded its operations from Queens and Brooklyn into Manhattan
 The company built or renovated skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses Trump later started various side ventures, mostly by licensing his name.
 He produced and hosted The Apprentice, a reality television series, from 2003 to 2015 As of 2020, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $2.
Trump entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated 16 other candidates in the primaries. His political positions have been described as populist, protectionist, and nationalist.
 Despite not being favored in most forecasts, he was elected over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, while still losing the popular vote
 He became the oldest first-term US. president,[b] and the first without prior military or government service. His election and policies have sparked numerous protests.
 Trump has made many false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency The statements have been documented by fact-checkers, and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American politics.
 Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged or racis
During his presidency, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; after legal challenges, the Supreme Court upheld the policy's third revision.
 He enacted a tax-cut package for individuals and businesses, rescinding the individual health insurance mandate penalty He appointed Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
 In foreign policy, Trump has pursued an America First agenda, withdrawing the US. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal.
 During increased tensions with Iran, he ordered the killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani He imposed import tariffs triggering a trade war with China, recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and withdrew U.
S troops from northern Syria to avoid Turkey's offensive on American-allied Kurds. Trump met three times with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, but talks on denuclearization broke down in 2019
A special counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller found that Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged Russian foreign interference in the 2016 presidential election under the belief that it would be politically advantageous, but did not find sufficient evidence to press charges of criminal conspiracy or coordination with Russia.
 Mueller also investigated Trump for obstruction of justice, and his report neither indicted nor exonerated Trump on that count
 A 2019 House of Representatives impeachment inquiry found that Trump solicited foreign interference in the 2020 US. presidential election from Ukraine to help his re-election bid and then obstructed the inquiry itself.
 The House impeached Trump on December 18, 2019, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress The Senate acquitted him of both charges on February 5, 2020
Mariano Rajoy Brey (Spanish: [maˈɾjano raˈxoj]; born 27 March 1955) is a Spanish politician who served as Prime Minister of Spain from 2011 to 2018, when a vote of no confidence ousted his government.
He became Leader of the People's Party in 2004 and Prime Minister in 2011 following the People's Party landslide victory in that year's general election becoming the sixth President of the Spanish Government.
[5] The party lost its majority in the 2015 general election, but after that election ended in deadlock, a second election in 2016 enabled Rajoy to be reelected Prime Minister as head of a minority government
 Rajoy was a Minister under the José María Aznar administration, occupying different leading roles in different Ministries between 1996 and 2003, and he also was the Deputy Prime Minister between 2000 and 2003
 He was the Leader of the Opposition between 2004 and 2011 under José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's governmen
Rajoy's first term was heavily marked by the Spanish financial crisis and oversaw a major restructuring of the Spanish financial system as well as a major labour reform.
 The financial crisis peaked with a bailout of the Spanish banking system in June 2012 Unemployment in Spain peaked at 27% in 2012, which led to an initial drop of the People's Party in the polls, which was aggravated by the revelations of a series of corruption cases that seriously damaged the party's reputation.
 This, among other factors, led to a profound shift in the Spanish party system, with the rise of new political parties from the left and the right: Podemos and Citizen
The 2015 general election led to a parliamentary configuration that made the formation of a government very difficult; as a result, Spain was without a government for over six months and new elections were held in June 2016.
 Rajoy was finally appointed Prime Minister with the support of the Citizens party and the abstention of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party
 Rajoy's second term was marked by economic recovery and a drop in unemployment and the challenge of stagnating salaries Rajoy also oversaw the 2017–18 Spanish constitutional crisis marked by the Catalan independence referendum of 2017 and the Catalan unilateral declaration of independence on 27 October 2017 that led to the imposition of direct rule in Catalonia
At 14 years and 146 days, Rajoy was the longest-serving Spanish politician in the Government of Spain since the Spanish transition to democracy, having held ministerial offices continuously from 1996 to 2004 and from 2011 to 2018
John Fitzgerald Kennedy (May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963), often referred to by his initials JFK and Jack, was an American politician who served as the 35th president of the United States from January 1961 until his assassination in November 1963.
 Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War, and the majority of his work as president concerned relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba
 A Democrat, Kennedy represented Massachusetts in the US. House of Representatives and Senate prior to becoming president
Kennedy was born into a wealthy political family in Brookline, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard University in 1940, before joining the U.
S Naval Reserve the following year. During World War II, he commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his service.
 After the war, Kennedy represented the Massachusetts's 11th congressional district in the US. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953.
 He was subsequently elected to the US. Senate and served as the junior Senator from Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. While in the Senate, Kennedy published his book, Profiles in Courage, which won a Pulitzer Prize.
 In the 1960 presidential election, he narrowly defeated Republican opponent Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent vice presiden
Kennedy's administration included high tensions with communist states in the Cold War. As a result, he increased the number of American military advisers in South Vietnam.
 In April 1961, he authorized an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro in the Bay of Pigs Invasion[2] Kennedy authorized the Cuban Project in November 1961.
 He rejected Operation Northwoods (plans for false flag attacks to gain approval for a war against Cuba) in March 1962 However, his administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962.
[3] The following October, US. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba; the resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict.
 The Strategic Hamlet Program began in Vietnam during his presidency Domestically, Kennedy presided over the establishment of the Peace Corps and the continuation of the Apollo space program.
 He also supported the civil rights movement, but was only somewhat successful in passing his New Frontier domestic policie
On November 22, 1963, he was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death.
 Marxist and former US. Marine Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for the state crime, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later.
 The FBI and the Warren Commission both concluded Oswald had acted alone in the assassination, but various groups contested the Warren Report and believed that Kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy
 After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the Civil Rights Act and the Revenue Act of 1964
 Kennedy ranks highly in polls of US. presidents with historians and the general public. His personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest, following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and extramarital affairs
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
 He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation.
 Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 199
A Xhosa, Mandela was born to the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, Union of South Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg.
 There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944
 After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, he and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow
 Mandela was appointed President of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People
 He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party (SACP).
 Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government
 He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state following the Rivonia Tria
Mandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island, Pollsmoor Prison, and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President F.
 W de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president.
 Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses
 Economically, Mandela's administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services
 Internationally, he acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999
 He declined a second presidential term, and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation
Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist and those on the far-left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism.
 Widely regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice, he received more than 250 honours—including the Nobel Peace Prize—and became the subject of a cult of personality
 He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Xhosa clan name, Madiba, and described as the "Father of the Nation

 There are different opinions about the meaning of the word Bacatá, the most accepted being that it means "walling of the farmland" in the Chibcha language
[17][18] Another popular translation argues that it means "The Lady of the Andes"[19] Further, the word 'Andes' in the Aymara language means "shining mountain", thus rendering the full lexical signification of Bogotá as "The Lady of the shining mountain" (notice, however, that the language of the Muisca people was not Aymara but Chibcha).
 Others suggest that Bacatá was the name of the Muisca cacique who governed the land before the Spaniards arrived[20] Jiménez de Quesada gave the settlement the name of "Our Lady of Hope" but the Spanish crown gave it the name of Santafé (Holy Faith) in 1540 when it was appointed as a city
Santafé became the seat of the government of the Spanish Royal Audiencia of the New Kingdom of Granada (created in 1550), and then after 1717 it was the capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada.
 After the Battle of Boyacá on 7 August 1819, Bogotá became the capital of the independent nation of Gran Colombia It was Simón Bolívar who rebaptized the city with the name of Bogotá, as a way of honoring the Muisca people and as an emancipation act towards the Spanish crown.
[19] Hence, since the Viceroyalty of New Granada's independence from the Spanish Empire and during the formation of present-day Colombia, Bogotá has remained the capital of this territor
The city is located in the center of Colombia, on a high plateau known as the Bogotá savanna, part of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense located in the Eastern Cordillera of the Andes.
 It is the third-highest capital in South America and in the world after Quito and La Paz, at an average of 2,640 metres (8,660 ft) above sea level
 Subdivided into 20 localities, Bogotá has an area of 1,587 square kilometres (613 square miles) and a relatively cool climate that is constant through the yea
The city is home to central offices of the executive branch (Office of the President), the legislative branch (Congress of Colombia) and the judicial branch (Supreme Court of Justice, Constitutional Court, Council of State and the Superior Council of Judicature) of the Colombian government.
 Bogotá stands out for its economic strength and associated financial maturity, its attractiveness to global companies and the quality of human capital
 It is the financial and commercial heart of Colombia, with the most business activity of any city in the country[21][22] The capital hosts the main financial market in Colombia and the Andean natural region, and is the leading destination for new foreign direct investment projects coming into Latin America and Colombia.
[23] It has the highest nominal GDP in the country, responsible for almost a quarter of the nation's total (247%)
The city's airport, El Dorado International Airport, named after the mythical El Dorado, handles the largest cargo volume in Latin America, and is third in number of people.
[24] Bogotá is home to the largest number of universities and research centers in the country,[22] and is an important cultural center, with many theaters, libraries and museums
 Bogotá ranks 52nd on the Global Cities Index 2014,[25] and is considered a global city type "Alpha −" by GaW
The Empire State Building is a 102-story[c] Art Deco skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan in New York City. It was designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon and built from 1930 to 1931.
 Its name is derived from "Empire State", the nickname of the state of New York The building has a roof height of 1,250 feet (380 m) and stands a total of 1,454 feet (443.
2 m) tall, including its antenna The Empire State Building stood as the world's tallest building until the construction of the World Trade Center in 1970; following its collapse in the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Empire State Building was again the city's tallest skyscraper until 2012.
 As of 2020, the building is the seventh-tallest building in New York City, the ninth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States, the 48th-tallest in the world, and the fifth-tallest freestanding structure in the America
The site of the Empire State Building, located in Midtown South on the west side of Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and 34th Streets, was originally part of an early 18th-century farm.
 It was developed in 1893 as the site of the Waldorf–Astoria Hotel In 1929, Empire State Inc. acquired the site and devised plans for a skyscraper there.
 The design for the Empire State Building was changed fifteen times until it was ensured to be the world's tallest building
 Construction started on March 17, 1930, and the building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on May 1, 1931 Despite favorable publicity related to the building's construction, because of the Great Depression and World War II, its owners did not make a profit until the early 1950s
The building's Art Deco architecture, height, and observation decks have made it a popular attraction. Around 4 million tourists from around the world annually visit the building's 86th and 102nd floor observatories; an additional indoor observatory on the 80th floor opened in 2019.
 The Empire State Building is an American cultural icon: it has been featured in more than 250 TV shows and movies since the film King Kong was released in 1933
 A symbol of New York City, the tower has been named as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers
 It was ranked first on the American Institute of Architects' List of America's Favorite Architecture in 2007 Additionally, the Empire State Building and its ground-floor interior were designated city landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1980, and were added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1986
The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.
 The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wal
Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.
 The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U
S $916 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri
The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage".
 It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative
The Basílica de la Sagrada Família also known as the Sagrada Família, is a large unfinished Roman Catholic minor basilica in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.
 Designed by Spanish/Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926), his work on the building is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site
[5] On 7 November 2010, Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the church and proclaimed it a minor basilic
On 19 March 1882, construction of the Sagrada Família began under architect Francisco de Paula del Villar. In 1883, when Villar resigned,[5] Gaudí took over as chief architect, transforming the project with his architectural and engineering style, combining Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau forms.
 Gaudí devoted the remainder of his life to the project, and he is buried in the crypt At the time of his death in 1926, less than a quarter of the project was complete
Relying solely on private donations, the Sagrada Família's construction progressed slowly and was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War.
 In July 1936, revolutionaries set fire to the crypt and broke their way into the workshop, partially destroying Gaudí's original plans, drawings and plaster models, which led to 16 years of work to piece together the fragments of the master model
[10] Construction resumed to intermittent progress in the 1950s Advancements in technologies such as computer aided design and computerised numerical control (CNC) have since enabled faster progress and construction passed the midpoint in 2010.
 However, some of the project's greatest challenges remain, including the construction of ten more spires, each symbolising an important Biblical figure in the New Testament
[9] It is anticipated that the building can be completed by 2026, the centenary of Gaudí's deat
The basilica has a long history of splitting opinion among the residents of Barcelona: over the initial possibility it might compete with Barcelona's cathedral, over Gaudí's design itself, over the possibility that work after Gaudí's death disregarded his design,[12] and the 2007 proposal to build a tunnel of Spain's high-speed rail link to France which could disturb its stability.
[13] Describing the Sagrada Família, art critic Rainer Zerbst said "it is probably impossible to find a church building anything like it in the entire history of art",[14] and Paul Goldberger describes it as "the most extraordinary personal interpretation of Gothic architecture since the Middle Ages"
[15] The basilica is not the cathedral church of the Archdiocese of Barcelona, as that title belongs to the Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulali
The Space Needle is an observation tower in Seattle, Washington, United States. It is a city landmark and is considered an icon of Seattle.
 Located in the Lower Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle, it was built in the Seattle Center for the 1962 World's Fair, which drew over 2
3 million visitors Nearly 20,000 people a day used its elevators during the event
Once the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River,[7] it is 605 ft (184 m) high, 138 ft (42 m) wide, and weighs 9,550 short tons (8,660 metric tons).
 It is built to withstand winds of up to 200 mph (320 km/h) and earthquakes of up to 90 magnitude,[8] as strong as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake.
The Space Needle has an observation deck at 520 ft (160 m).[7] It features views of the downtown Seattle skyline, the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Elliott Bay, and surrounding islands in Puget Sound
Visitors can reach the top of the Space Needle by elevators that travel at 10 mph (16 km/h). The trip takes 41 seconds. On windy days, the elevators slow to 5 mph (8.
0 km/h) On April 19, 1999, the city's Landmarks Preservation Board designated it a historic landmark
In September 2017, the tower's SkyCity restaurant was closed as part of a $100 million renovation. The renovation included the installation of a new rotation motor and see-through glass floors in the restaurant space, as well as the replacement of the observation deck's wire enclosure with glass panels.
[11][12] The space reopened in August 2018 as the Loupe, an indoor observation dec
Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the striking clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London[1] and is usually extended to refer to both the clock and the clock tower.
[2][3] The official name of the tower in which Big Ben is located was originally the Clock Tower, but it was renamed Elizabeth Tower in 2012 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth I
The tower was designed by Augustus Pugin in a neo-Gothic style. When completed in 1859, its clock was the largest and most accurate four-faced striking and chiming clock in the world.
[4] The tower stands 315 feet (96 m) tall, and the climb from ground level to the belfry is 334 steps Its base is square, measuring 39 feet (12 m) on each side.
 Dials of the clock are 23 feet (70 m) in diameter. On 31 May 2009, celebrations were held to mark the tower's 150th anniversary
Big Ben is the largest of the tower's five bells and weighs 13.5 long tons (13.7 tonnes; 15.1 short tons).[1] It was the largest bell in the United Kingdom for 23 years.
 The origin of the bell's nickname is open to question; it may be named after Sir Benjamin Hall, who oversaw its installation, or heavyweight boxing champion Benjamin Caunt
 Four quarter bells chime at 15, 30 and 45 minutes past the hour and just before Big Ben tolls on the hour The clock uses its original Victorian mechanism, but an electric motor can be used as a backup
The tower is a British cultural icon recognised all over the world. It is one of the most prominent symbols of the United Kingdom and parliamentary democracy,[6] and it is often used in the establishing shot of films set in London.
[7] The clock tower has been part of a Grade I listed building since 1970 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 198
On 21 August 2017, a four-year schedule of renovation works began on the tower, which are to include the addition of a lift.
 There are also plans to re-glaze and repaint the clock dials With a few exceptions, such as New Year's Eve and Remembrance Sunday, the bells are to be silent until the work is completed in 2021
The Burj Khalifa, known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration in 2010, is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
 With a total height of 8298 m (2,722 ft) and a roof height (excluding antenna, but including a 244 m spire[2]) of 828 m (2,717 ft), the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest structure and building in the world since its topping out in 2009
Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete.
 The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai It is designed to be the centrepiece of large-scale, mixed-use development.
 The decision to construct the building is based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition
 The building was originally named Burj Dubai but was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan;[5] Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts
 The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the tallest building in the worl
Burj Khalifa was designed by Adrian Smith, of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, whose firm designed the Willis Tower and One World Trade Center.
 Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project
 The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space.
 A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III, the Burj Khalifa's central core houses all vertical transportation with the exception of egress stairs within each of the wings.
 The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot summer temperatures It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators
At a certain point in the architectural and engineering process, the original Emaar developers ran into financial issues, and required more money and economic funding.
 Sheikh Khalifa, the ruler of the United Arab Emirates, granted monetary aid and funding, hence resulting in the changing of the name to "Burj Khalifa"
 The concept of profitability derived from building high density developments and malls around the landmark have proven successful
 Its surrounding malls, hotels and condominiums in Downtown Dubai have generated the most revenue from the project as a whole, while the Burj Khalifa itself made little or no profi
Critical reception to Burj Khalifa has been generally positive, and the building has received many awards. There were complaints concerning migrant workers from South Asia who were the primary building labor force.
 These centered on low wages and the practice of confiscating passports until duties were complete[9] Several suicides were reported
The Taipei 101 formerly known as the Taipei World Financial Center, is a supertall skyscraper designed by C.Y. Lee and C.
P Wang in Xinyi, Taipei, Taiwan. This building was officially classified as the world's tallest from its opening in 2004 until the 2010 completion of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates
Its elevators, capable of traveling 60.6 km/h (37.7 mph) and used to transport passengers from the 5th to 89th floor in 37 seconds, set new records upon completion.
[12] In 2011 Taipei 101 received a Platinum rating under the LEED certification system to become the tallest and largest green building in the world
[13][14] The structure regularly appears as an icon of Taipei in international media, and the Taipei 101 fireworks displays [zh] are a regular feature of New Year's Eve broadcast
Taipei 101's postmodernist architectural style evokes traditional Asian aesthetics in a modern structure employing industrial materials.
 Its design incorporates a number of features that enable the structure to withstand the Pacific Ring of Fire's earthquakes and the region's tropical storms
 The tower houses offices and restaurants as well as both indoor and outdoor observatories The tower is adjoined by a multilevel shopping mall that has the world's largest ruyi symbol as an exterior feature
Taipei 101 is owned by Taipei Financial Center Corporation. The skyscraper opened on 31 December 2004 to celebrate New Year's Eve
The Walt Disney World Resort, also called Walt Disney World and Disney World, is an entertainment complex in Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, Florida, in the United States, near the cities Orlando and Kissimmee.

 It was first operated by Walt Disney World Company The property covers nearly 25,000 acres (39 sq mi; 101 km2), of which only half has been used.
[3] The resort comprises four theme parks (consisting of Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom), two water parks, 27 themed resort hotels, nine non-Disney hotels, several golf courses, a camping resort, and other entertainment venues, including the outdoor shopping center Disney Spring
Designed to supplement Disneyland, in Anaheim, California, which had opened in 1955, the complex was developed by Walt Disney in the 1960s.
 "The Florida Project", as it was known, was intended to present a distinct vision with its own diverse set of attractions
 Walt Disney's original plans also called for the inclusion of an "Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow" (EPCOT), a planned community intended to serve as a test bed for new city-living innovations
 Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, during the initial planning of the complex After his death, the company wrestled with the idea of whether to bring the Disneyworld project to fruition.
 Walt's older brother, Roy, came out of retirement to make sure Walt's biggest dream was realized, (construction started in 1967) but without Walt spearheading the construction, the company built a resort similar to Disneyland, abandoning the experimental concepts for a planned community
 Magic Kingdom was the first theme park to open in the complex, in 1971, followed by Epcot (1982), Disney's Hollywood Studios (1989), and Disney's Animal Kingdom (1998)
 It was Roy who insisted the name of the entire complex be changed from Disneyworld, to Walt Disney World, ensuring that people would remember that the project was Walt's drea
In 2018, Walt Disney World was the most visited vacation resort in the world, with an average annual attendance of more than 58 million.
 The resort is the flagship destination of Disney's worldwide corporate enterprise and has become a popular staple in American culture
 In March 2020, Walt Disney World was closed in response to the coronavirus pandemic; since then, Disney Springs has reopened, with plans to reopen the parks in Jul

 The Central Valley, a major agricultural area, dominates the state's center Although California is well-known for its warm Mediterranean climate, the large size of the state results in climates that vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north to arid desert in the interior, as well as snowy alpine in the mountains.
What is now California was first settled by various Native Californian tribes before being explored by a number of European colonizers during the 16th and 17th centuries.
 The Spanish Empire then claimed and colonized it In 1804 it was included in Alta California province, within the Viceroyalty of New Spain.
 The area became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican–American War
 The western portion of Alta California was then organized and admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850 The California Gold Rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes, with large-scale emigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom

 Built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete,[1] it was the largest amphitheatre ever built at the time and held 50,000 to 80,000 spectators
 The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72[2] and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus.
[3] Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81–96)[4] These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name (Flavius)
The Colosseum could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points of its history over the centuries,[5][6] having an average audience of some 65,000;[7][8] it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles (for only a short time as the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other activities), animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology.
 The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine
Although substantially ruined because of earthquakes and stone-robbers, the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and is listed as one of the New7Wonders of the World.
[9] It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the Cross" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum
[10] In 2018, it was the most popular tourist attraction in the world, with 74 million visitors
